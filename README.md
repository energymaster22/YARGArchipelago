3. Go into "Quickplay"
4. All of your collected songs will appear at the top in an "AP Songs" catagory
5. Play the songs that appear there to get checks for your multiworld!
6. When you get your goal song it will appear in an "AP Goal Song" catagory along with details on what you still need.
7. Collect the rest of the YARG Gems in the multiworld to fully unlock the goal song.
7. Play that song to finish the seed!

# Current Notes
"Star Power Bonus" items grant 25% Star Power upon collection\
\
If a song does not support your current instrument, or you otherwise cannot complete the song, you can use a bot player to clear it

# Common Problems
## My songs are not loading!

+ This can be caused by a few things. First make sure that you have downloaded the setlists from the YARC launcher.

+ Sometimes YARG needs to rescan of your library, to do so, go to Settings> Songs and click "Scan songs" up at the top

+ Other times YARG forks do not find the YARC setlists automatically. This is a slightly more involved fix:

1. Open the YARC Launcher
2. Scroll all the way down the left panel
3. Click the Settings button on the bottom left
4. Note the directory under "File Management"
5. In the YARGAPClient go to Settings> Songs
6. Click "Add New Folder" 
7. Click "Browse" on the new entry
8. Navigate to the folder you saw in the YARC Launcher settings
9. Within the YARC install folder selct the "Setlists" folder
10. Click "Scan Songs"
